# [WIP] ethereum-zk-client

An ultra-light Ethereum client that uses ZK SNARKs to prove the validity of Ethereum block headers.  
Can be used as an Ethereum light node or in light client based bridges.

- [x] Circom circuit for Ethereum header.
- [ ] Node library for generating the proof.
- [ ] Solidity SNARK verifier smart contract for validating the proof.
- [ ] Circom circuit for EthHash (modified Dagger-Nakomoto hash circuit).
